Dear {}

Congratulations! You have been chosen by the ARC's Course Compliments Program to take a professor/TA to lunch/dinner. The professor/TA you want to take to lunch/dinner is: {}. 

We will reimburse you up to $30 total (including tips, etc) for the meal. There are no restrictions on the location or time of the meal. You can choose to email the professor yourselves or have us arrange the lunch/dinner. Since funding works through reimbursements, you will need to pay at the lunch/dinner, save the receipt(s), and then email a picture of the receipt(s) to Irene Chang, the ASCIT Treasurer, at ichang@caltech.edu. 

Please let us know you've emailed her so we can let her know to take it out of the ARC's budget for this program. Please respond by next week ({}) on whether you plan to accept this award or not. If we do not receive a response by then, we will assume that you forfeit the award and designate it to someone else. If you choose to accept the award, the award is valid until {} (End of term). So be sure to host the lunch/dinner and bring us the reimbursement before then! Feel free to let us know if you have any more questions, and hope you have a good lunch/dinner!
